/**
 * In this examples child class constructor does not use any parameterized constructor of parent class

 * So by default only non parameterized constructor of parent class is called which sets value of aInt to 11.
 * Child class's constructor also initializes its (duplicate) variable aInt's value to 11 initially.
 * Overridden methods always access instance variable of child class if names are same unless specified the parent class's variable
 * by super keyword.
